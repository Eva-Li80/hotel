              <h2 style={{ fontSize: 25 }}>Why Choosing Venice Lido</h2>
              <p>
                Venice Lido is a unique location for your stay: it is perfectly
                suitable to enjoy a seaside holiday as well as spend some days
                in Venice. The perfect balance of beauty, beaches and culture
                make of Venice Lido and Hotel Cristallo the ideal location for
                any kind of stay and vacation preference: a seaside holiday with
                your family, a romantic stay in the Lagoon, a cultural weekend
                to attend the Biennale. Our hotel is also a few minutes away
                from the Venice Film Festivalâ€™s main location, in the heart of
                Venetian movida, and near stores and boutiques for shopping
                along the Gran Viale. Lido is also very lively in autumn and
                winter, unlike other seaside resorts, and is among the top
                places offering outstanding value for money in this season.
